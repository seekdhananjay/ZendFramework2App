This is all about Zend Framework 2.06

This package is for the people who don't have internet all the time.

just download it & after extracting put it in your web root folder(/var/www/ or htdocs) and start working on it.
if you want, you can rename this extracted folder whatever you want(suppose it is zf2app).
 for checking it's working or not, just write in your web browser

http://localhost/zf2app/public/
